# Mistborn Text based Adventure game
A text-based adventure game based on the world of Mistborn. Your goal will be to survive the events of the book.
## Hopefully, these features will be implemented:
A time / timeline system, where certain events are triggered at certain times.
Random events you will have to deal with, depending on where you are.
A map you can move across. 
The goal will be for it to read like a book, and at the end when you die or survive you can read through the adventure. It would be cool to display this on like its own window with a cool visual style and things but I will shoot for a command line interface first. 
## I hope to complete a playable prototype of this with some or all features implemented.
### But don't get your hopes up.
